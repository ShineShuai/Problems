Here contains some problems related to the probabilites.

##### Problem 1 : Black/White balls

There are 100 white balls and 100 black balls in a bucket. Repeat the following actions:
- Randomly take 2 balls out from the bucket every time.
  - Put 1 black ball into the bucket, if their colors are same.
  - Put 1 white ball into the bucket, if their colors are different.

What is the probability of that the only 1 black ball remains in the bucket?

##### Problem 2 : Random Number Generator

1. Consider a random function f() that returns 0 with a probability of 60% and 1 with a probability of 40%. Implement a function g() using f() such that g() returns 0 and 1 with a probability of 50%.

2. Write a function to generate a random integer between 0 and 4, given a function that generates a random integer between 0 and 2; namely, implement rand5() using rand3().

 Conversely, implement rand3() using rand5().

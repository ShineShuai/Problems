Problem 1 : Black/White balls

There are 100 white balls and 100 black balls in a bucket. Repeat the following actions:
1.) Randomly take 2 balls out from the bucket every time.
2.) Put 1 black ball into the bucket, if their colors are same.
3.) Put 1 white ball into the bucket, if their colors are different.

What is the probability of that the only 1 black ball remains in the bucket?
